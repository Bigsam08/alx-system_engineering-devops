LOAD BALANCER
# an app distributing our different http responses to our servers
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we’re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
